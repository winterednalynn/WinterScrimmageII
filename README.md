Final Presentation

Talk about the language you choose, why, and what you decide to try to build it with? 

My selected language for this final presentation is focused on Python. The purpose of producing my final in Python stems from the idea of my friends and patients. I have friends in the industry that codes in Python. Which is loved because of  the flexibility and how easy it is on the eyes. Serving patients in the Seattle area, I've met numerous software engineers and 4 of the highly suggested language is Javascript, Java, Go and Python. My final is called Winter Scrimmage II, this idea is rooted from Computer Programming I. This was one of the extra credit assignment titled "Personal Project" With constructing this renovated game with Python was an experience. 

Tell us about your project. Your grade will not necessarily be based on "completeness".

Winter Scrimmage II is a game of chance. Player vs Bot. No skills required. The game functions predominately on random. You roll the snowflakes and a random number will be generated. The chosen random number will then be display by square like figures. I coded in a score system where it is programmed to track the amount of times a player wins a round and same for the bot. In my project, it goes until 5 rounds but this can easily be modified to any number of rounds the user wants. 

Talk about your experiences while learning to use it. Where did you run into headaches? What did you do to solve problems

Producing this game, I ran into little fussy details. I'm not sure if its because of the IDE i am using but it's very particular when it comes to spacing, aligning, and lower case usage. If my alignment was off, the display of my code dipict itself in this odd placement. It took me awhile to figure why the arrangment was being placed the way it is and it was the most simple fix but also, i mainly played around parts of my coding that had the word print. 

Another difficulty I ran into was score upkeep for both player and bot. In C#, ++ is  used as a behavior of increase by 1 but in Python its " +=1 " (thank you stackoverflow), it sounded simple but although my syntax was correct, there was a code I added into the program that restarted the score count. Which was input() . This was added after my "if" conditional statement in highlights of the score. I thought placing the input() would register what was being spawed but it basically restarted the count. After playing with the code endless of times, I realized that the score is working but it's restarting , and by chance I removed the input() and my score was finally accumulating. 

Lastly, troublesome part of this project was the build of the square. I learned that python has a object called unicode. Basically these can be characters that can be printed. I coded print unicode of angles and lines to construct the square. I also was able to find a snowflake which was so fitting for this final. After, playing with the square for over 2 hours , i couldn't figure out why when I add the snowflake in the middle the line couldnt line itself correctly. I tried multiple times to perfect this. However, I came up with a dipiction thats not too perfect but it works. 


Give honest opinions about the languages and things you learn.
I learn that when you learn one programming language it could be a little easier to grasp an understanding for other languages. I played this code game dedicated to Swift on my ipad and I see a lot of similarities. With Python, it's the same story. There's are different syntax but for the most part the function plays are in the same vicinity. It's entertaining to learn a new language because it expands the knowledge you know and knowledge you don't know.
